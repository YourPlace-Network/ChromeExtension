# YourPlace Chrome Extension
## Distributed Social Media
This is the Chrome Extension for YourPlace, a distributed social media platform that gives complete sovereignty back to users. You own your content creation, publishing, consumption and follower relationships.

The extension gives deep YourPlace integration into traditional web2 social media sites via your browser. It allows embedding of your YourPlace content into these sites, and vice versa.

Currently supported sites include:
* X.com
* YouTube.com

It is designed to work with the [YourPlace Server](https://yourplace.network/download) and you must be running it to get full effect
